Maroon 5 has its roots in the high school friendship of four of the group members. The band earned a Best New Artist Grammy Award on the strength of their first album. They became pop superstars with a string of eight consecutive top 10 pop hit singles from 2011 through 2015. Maroon 5 did originally have five members. But the group has grown a lot since then, so it makes sense that they've added more musicians into the mix. And while Levine, Carmichael, and Madden are still active band members, Dusick left Maroon 5 in 2006, according to Reuters.
