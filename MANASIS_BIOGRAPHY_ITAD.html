                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Childhood was fun.<sup>1</sup> I was a very shy back then.<sup>2</sup>
                I did play outside to play with my friends and my sister but when someone older than me wants to play I am very shy to play with them.<sup>3</sup>
                I really like watching cartoon when I was a child.<sup>4</sup>
                My favorite cartoon that I rally watch everyday is tom and jerry, Mr.Bean and spongebob.<sup>5</sup>
                My auntie always spoil me to the things I want.<sup>6</sup>I dont really go to the mall or go outside because I was very shy to people older than me.<sup>7</sup>
                I didnt grow up with my dad because he died a month after my mother give a birth to me.<sup>8</sup>
                He died in a cargo ship during work.<sup>9</sup> Thats why my mother and my auntie is the people that is there for me up until now.<sup>10</sup>
                During my childhood days I also like playing video games.<sup>11</sup> My mother is always upset with me because I have to stay awake all night just to play video games.<sup>12</sup>
                I have this device called gameboy and psp and I would rather use those two device the whole day than playing with my friends.<sup>13</sup>
                But when I play with my friends outside we have this toy called pellet gun and we go play cops and criminals.<sup>14</sup> 
                My parents is very protective because I was a lazy person.<sup>15</sup>
                My auntie is always mad at me because everytime when I go home after playing outside I always got small wound.<sup>16</sup>I also have a bike when I was a child.<sup>17</sup>
                Me and my bestfriend always to go for a stroll to the whole subdivision everymorning.<sup>18</sup> I am an introvert person back then so I only have a few friends in school and in our subdivision.<sup>19</sup>
                But I dont regret that because I like keeping my  social circle small.<sup>20</sup> I may have small circle of friends but they give me a lot of fun memories.<sup>21</sup>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College wasn't really that fun.<sup>1</sup> I wasn't that scared when I first started college.<sup>2</sup> My only burden that time is I have to be confident enough again to talk to other people.<sup>3</sup>
                    I stayed at UE manila because I really like the envirorment here.<sup>4</sup> During this time I set my mind that I really need to take this seriously.<sup>5</sup> I am not a teenager anymore and this is my stepping stone to my dreams.<sup>6</sup>
                    Programming was tough during my first encounter with it.<sup>6</sup> I become an athlete during 1st sem.<sup>7</sup>I stop being athlete because I can't handle the schedule of practice hours.<sup>8</sup>
                    I met my first girlfriend during 1st year college.<sup>9</sup> At first I was very nervouse because I never had a girlfriend before but then I become me.<sup>10</sup> I didn't change my personality she just loved the way I am.<sup>11</sup> 
                    I always wait her after class then we go on a night date.<sup>11</sup> I was really happy that time because I can handle both acads and my relationship to her.<sup>12</sup> Don't get me wrong I am also good relation with my family.<sup>13</sup>
                    Then Pandemic came.<sup>14</sup> When the pandemic come I become lost again.<sup>15</sup> My girlfriend and I broke up due to personal reasons.<sup>16</sup> I stopped a year in college because we dont have pc and internet connection at home.<sup>17</sup>
                    During the year I stopped college,I meditate a lot to be mentally stable.<sup>18</sup> But now I am ready to take online class.<sup>19</sup> <strong> I leave all the negative mindset and all the "What if?"</strong> in my mind.<sup>20</sup> I realize that I still have a long journey to go and this is just the beggining.<sup>21</sup>
                    I just hope that before I graduate I want to experience the face to face again.<sup>22</sup>
